# Project

Factorio MOD.

# Development

## Build and Install

- `mise run install` - Install to local Factorio MOD directory. Uses `git archive` internally, so only committed files are included — commit changes before running.

## Temporary files

Use the `tmp/` directory for temporary files. Create it if it doesn't exist. It is gitignored.

## Release

Releases are handled by GitHub Actions workflows. Do not run `mise run release:*` tasks manually.

Changelog is managed by `factorix mod changelog` and follows Factorio's changelog.txt specification.

### What to write in changelog.txt

- Regular releases: limit entries to user-visible changes only.
- Initial release: write "Initial release" only, under the `Features` category.

### Updating the changelog during development

Write entries in the Unreleased section at the top of the file. If no Unreleased section exists, create one.

Do not create a section for the next release version directly — version bumping is handled by the GitHub Actions release workflow.
